# tf2-internal-imgui
- Lak3's TF2 internal, I just implemented DIrectX hooking (EndScene, Reset), then added ImGui to it, for hooking used MinHook. 
- Uninject also works.
- Implemented in a smooth, beautiful way.
- Changed files: Entry.h, Entry.cpp.

# Setup
1. Add "hl2_src" folder into "SDK" folder.  
2. Open Visual Studio.
3. Set the project to Release | x86.
4. Build and inject to the game.
